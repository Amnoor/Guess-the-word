# Guess the word
I wrote a python code for me to practice my code.\
This code is called "Guess the word" a game we all are familiar with.\
There there will be 10 words and everytime you run the code, one out of those 10 words will be selected, Your job is to guess that word, you have 9 tries to guess the correct word, if not then you loose.
